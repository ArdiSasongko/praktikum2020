## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(tibble)
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

## Nomor 1

```{r}
murders_tibble = as_tibble(murders)
```

## Nomor 2
```{r}
as_tibble(murders) %>% group_by(region)
```

## Nomor 3
```{r}
murders %>% .$population %>% log %>% mean %>% exp
```

## Nomor 4
```{r}
a = 1
b = 100
n = a:b
s_n = function(n){
  x = a:b
  x = x+x
}
s_n_2 = function(n){
  x = a:b
  x = x+x
  x = x^2
}
my_df <- data.frame(n,s_n(n),s_n_2(n))
my_df
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
